## comptype operation definitions
*Symbolic fields are defined as {x},{y} or anything that is non-real in the p/t field.*
*Formats are defined as a lower case string that, each implementation may support different formats. Typical formats are: vintage, legacy, commander, modern, pauper, pioneer, standard, penny dreadful and oathbreaker but several other formats exist.*
*Only the o comptype supports regex*
*All cards with symbolic power/toughness should be put after the non-symbolic power/toughness cards.*

## Usage
The AST describes how to create a query for searching cards. The implementations will take a given card and return true or false depending on whether the card matches the query.
